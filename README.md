# Containerized Micro-services

This project is a reference solution for building out a full Production ready micro-services solution. This solution is hosted in Kubernetes running on Azure. All apps and services have a small (micro-service) footprint of responsibilities and are run in Docker containers. This solution is meant to be a best practice example of a micro-service development and hosting solution ready for Production.

## Solution Overview

- Cross platform solution (runs on Linux, Windows and Mac)
- Source repositories hosted in Git
- Continuous Integration (CI) including unit & integration tests via [VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/) (Visual Studio Team Services)
- Continuous Deployment (CD) via [VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/)
- Containerized services hosted in Kubernetes (k8)
- Secrets management via [Azure KeyVault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/), [k8 secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) and Hexodite
- [Azure Active Directory Service Principal identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects) and least privilege access policies
- [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) k8 package deployments
- [Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/traffic-manager/) DNS request routing
- [Traefik ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/traefik) k8 traffic routing
- [Canary deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#canary-deployments)
- Azure k8 cluster deployment via [ACS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/kubernetes/features.md)
- Application Insights telemetry
- Log Analytics k8 cluster health dashboard

## Included in this Solution

### Deployment scripts

[Deployment scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/containerized-microservices-pipeline/tree/master/deployment)

Deployment scripts are provided as part of the reference solution that will setup a new Azure Subscription with all of the necessary resources, create Azure Active Directory Service Principal service accounts, grant needed access and deploy out n number of k8 clusters. Documentation for CI / CD setup in VSTS is provided to enable you to get a full end-to-end pipeline micro-service pipeline setup in no time.

### Example Angular app micro-service

[https://github.com/Microsoft/containerized-microservices-pipeline-app](https://github.com/Microsoft/containerized-microservices-pipeline-app)

An example front end web app written in Angular is provided as part of the solution, including a suite of unit and integration tests that are run when a Pull Request is created for a robust CI process. Changes to the app micro-service is automatically deployed to the canary pods as part of the CD process.

### Example .NET Core api micro-service

[https://github.com/Microsoft/containerized-microservices-pipeline-service](https://github.com/Microsoft/containerized-microservices-pipeline-service)

An example cross platform middle tier api is provided as part of the solution, including a suite of unit and integration tests that are run when a Pull Request is created for a robust CI process. Changes to the api micro-service is automatically deployed to the canary pods as part of the CD process.
